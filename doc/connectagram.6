.PP
Connectagram is a word unscrambling game. The board consists of several
scrambled words that are joined together. You can choose the length of
the words, the amount of words, and the pattern that the words are arranged
in. The game provides a hint option for times when you are stuck, and
features an online word lookup that fetches the definitions of each word
from Wiktionary. Your current progress is automatically saved.

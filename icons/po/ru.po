"Connectagram is a word unscrambling game. The board consists of several "
"scrambled words that are joined together. You can choose the length of the "
"words, the amount of words, and the pattern that the words are arranged in. "
"The game provides a hint option for times when you are stuck, and features "
"an online word lookup that fetches the definitions of each word from "
"Wiktionary. Your current progress is automatically saved."
